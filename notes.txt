obtaining sensor data through carla:
the defined sensor through sensor=world.spawn_actor(...) can call a method called listen like this:
sensor.listen(save_image_method)
the save_image_method must receive an input variable image that can be used through np.frombuffer:
data = np.frombuffer(image, dtype)
that data is processed to obtain a surface for pygame rendering
then it is rendered.

We could get that data and feed it directly to other methods.

Next step: jun 18
How the menu class can display the data obtained from the sensors and from inference
