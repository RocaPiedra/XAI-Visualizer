obtaining sensor data through carla:
the defined sensor through sensor=world.spawn_actor(...) can call a method called listen like this:
sensor.listen(save_image_method)
the save_image_method must receive an input variable image that can be used through np.frombuffer:
data = np.frombuffer(image, dtype)
that data is processed to obtain a surface for pygame rendering
then it is rendered.

We could get that data and feed it directly to other methods.

Next step: jun 18
How the menu class can display the data obtained from the sensors and from inference

july 5:
avoid having gpu out of memory error
option:
select window:
if window belongs to cam windows: to choose the model and cam method for selected window.

if window belongs to camera window: select that window as input for the cam method. DONE (July 7)

Filter interesting classes! at least for Coco dataset

July 7:
Solve the bug that keeps showing the cam image when the system is not paused (image blinks)
