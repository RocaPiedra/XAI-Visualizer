# XAI-Visualizer
Your favourite repository to open the deep learning black box! This is a work in progress for my master thesis, you are welcome to play with it but some functionalities may be incomplete.


## Features

- Visualization gradient based methods 
- Various deep learning architectures
- Input flexibility. It works with cameras, image folders and video files
- Integration with Carla Simulator (TBD)
- Windows and Linux ready
- CPU and GPU accelerated, you choose

## Installation
### Visualizer
This repository uses PyTorch as machine learning framework. To install it, follow the next steps:
- Go to [PyTorch's](https://pytorch.org/) site and find the get started locally section.
- Specify the appropriate configuration options for your particular environment.
- Run the presented command in the terminal to install PyTorch.

Additionally, you can install the necessary python packages using pip.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Simulator (TBD)

# References
This repository could not be possible without the incredible work of Utku Ozbulak. He managed to implement a ton of visualization methods in his repository [PyTorch CNN Visualizations](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations). I just wanted to create a platform that would allow better comprehension and a wide variety of tools to test the different methods.
